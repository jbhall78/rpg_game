- = not fixed
* = probably fixed

- Sometimes menu items don't work properly
  (to replicate make sure you have moved in all directions, then open the
   menu and try to choose a menu item)
- Sometimes a player will get stuck moving in a particular direction
  (dont know how to replicate it totally but it seems to happen most of the
   time -- if not all of the time when hitting a corner of a block)
- Menu titles dont work.
- OnScreen() always returns TRUE
- NPC's can move diagonally through objects
