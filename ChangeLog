v0.01 - Blockmovement on a non scrolling map implemented.

Oct 7th 2001
v0.02 - Scrolling map.

Oct 7th 2001
v0.03 - Fixed width font engine.

Oct 8th 2001
v0.04 - Window engine with alpha blended background.

Oct 8th 2001
v0.05 - Menu engine started.

Oct 9th 2001
v0.06 - Game Modes implemented and Menu selections / callbacks completed.

Oct 9th 2001
v0.07 - Engine modified to draw different frames from player.bmp depending on
        which direction the player is moving.

Oct 10th 2001
v0.08 - Incremental player movement (in preparation for animation frames). 
        When the player moves into a region where the map needs to scroll it
        looks really crappy right now because I dont have support for
        incremental map scrolling implemented. A possible quick hack for this
        problem might be to delay map scroll update until the player is
        positioned into the new region.

Oct 10th 2001
v0.09 - Incremental player and map movement complete. Notes for next few 
        versions: Implement progress widget (InitMap() now takes signifigantly
        longer to run.. in the future I will probably have some incremental
        map loading scheme, but for the mean time i would like to see a little
        progress dialog =) Implement animation frames (should be pretty easy
        once drawn). 

Oct 10th 2001
v0.10 - Player animation frames implemented. East/west frames are kinda ugly
        might want to change them soon.

Oct 11th 2001
v0.11 - Added initial support for NPC's. They appear on the screen and will
        scroll with map. 

Oct 11th 2001
v0.12 - NPC's move. Not very intelligently nor does it play the animation 
        frames for NPCs.. gotta wait till v0.13 ;)

Oct 11th 2001
v0.13 - NPC animation frames implemented.

Oct 12th 2001
v0.14 - NPC animations fixed. (changed x/y modifiers to floats instead of
        ints.. remainders were getting dropped which made a large jump at the
        end of the animation sequence when a high number of movement frames
        were being used) NPC's and Players can no longer occupy the same tile.

Oct 13th 2001
v0.15 - Major code cleanup / reworking. Got rid of all Init*() functions and
        replaced them with Create*() equivilants. Got rid of all global
        variables (a few static variables still exist.. will get rid of those
        soon). Created a G_Game structure where all game data is held (map,
        video, player, npcs, etc). Made the map tiles dynamically allocated.
        Seperated Core, Map, NPC, Player, Window functions into different
        files. Moved source files into src/ subdirectory. Split game-todo.txt
        into BUGS, ChangeLog and TODO files. Added toplevel Makefile. 
        Moved includes into includes.h moved all defines, structures and
        function declarations into game.h. Haven't tested things much. Will
        Probably have to fix a few bugs =)

Oct 13th 2001
v0.16 - x/y mod change code moved from Draw*() routines to Update*() routines.
        Player x/y modifiers changed from ints to floats. Initial tile position
        of NPCs and Player is set to occupied. ProcessEvents and UpdateGame
        are called only at certain time intervals. DrawGame runs every game
        loop. (for maximum framerate and a consistent timed gameplay).

Oct 15th 2001
v0.17 - Window -
          * Added TextBox widget (some routines not complete, but works)
      - Player -
          * Added support for player interaction with NPCs (contact and
            use functions)
      - NPC -
          * Added initial support for NPC script trees.
          * Moved npcs array to G_Map structure.
      - Core - 
          * Added additional mode NPC_INTERACTION. 
          * Moved arrow key/up down information to G_Game structure. 

Oct 16th 2001
v0.18 - NPC -
          * Added support for SCRIPT_PLAYER_MENU and SCRIPT_PLAYER_MSG in
            script trees.

v0.19 - Final version of current branch of engine. I want some more features and will need to make
        some extensive modifications. I did make a couple bugfixes in this release but nothing
        really big to mention.

v0.20 - Well. I decided to keep working on this branch. I figured that I wouldnt implement things
        very different then the way I have them now. I just need to incorporate the engine changes
        I want to make in this branch. I did create a src-skel directory where I started working
        on things. ANYWAYS, onto the changes in this version =)

        I figured out what was causing my slow map blits.. it wasnt anything code related. It was
        the format of the tile bitmaps. I converted the bitmaps to indexed vs. rgb and it took
        the engine from around 20fps barebones (the src-skel version) to 50fps. I guess this will
        impose a limit on the number of colors that can be used on a single map tile (255.. it
        might be possible to create a larger pallete with the bitmap file format though). 255
        *should* be plenty though. For this game anyways.

        I also figured out the nasty little bug in ProcessEvents(). Basicly what was going on is
        I was reading the game mode before the while(pollevent()) loop. So when 2 events got 
        queued and the mode was changed by the first event, when processing the second event
        the mode would still be what it was originally! Anyways, its fixed. I'm feeling good
        about the future of this game =)

v0.21 - Created the G_Sceen structure. Moved some screen related functions into screen.c.
        Moved memory functions into util.c. Modified a lot of argument lists to functions 
        (mainly to make things work cleanly with the new G_Screen struct). Did a little bit
        of house cleaning on the source tree.

Oct 18th 2001
v0.22 - Multiple tile layers implemented. Player/NPC draw functions moved to DrawMap().
        Transparency has some issues with the layers.. as tiles use indexed pallettes now.
