These are the concepts for which I need to write SDL code for:
(kinda ranked in order of importance)

* = completed
@ = partially complete
- = not started

* Player Movement
* Fonts (for menu options)
* Different Game Modes (map movement, menu movement, battle screen)
* Background Tiles with properties (eg. nopass tiles)
* Translucent Menu Backgrounds
* Sprites (with animation frames)
* Different map layers

@ Menu Movement (with repeat.. but not annoyingly)
@ NPC Movement with player interaction (talk, battle)
@ Allow support for various resolutions, bit depths and full screen mode.

# Widgets / Other Graphics stuff
- Progress display window
- Different font text colors (while utilizing a standard font)
- Different player colors 

# Map
- Animated tiles
- Roof tiles
- Items that can be found on maps.. they will be placed in player inventory when picked up
- Boxes on map which contain items
- Support for loading map from file
- Map fog (possibly for enemy compounds)
- Mini map or Overlay map (to track where you are in world/compound)

# Music
- MIDI or MP3 music tracks (map, city, enemy compound [dungeon])
- WAV menu sound effects
- WAV game sound effects (blaster fire, battle start, etc)

# Game Functionality
- Player vs. NPC battle screen
- Save/Load Game Configuration
- Save/Load Game feature
- Player Inventory screen
- Player Statistics screen
- Item / Enemy Library
- Support for loading / writing XML files with libxml (for save game/map files)
- Make sure timing works similar on different speed processors
